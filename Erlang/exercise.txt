PART 1 : BASIC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
01. collatz(Integer) -> List
    Defined for positive integers n. Returns a list starting with N. Each
    subsequent value is computed from the previous value according to this rule:
    * The list ends with 1.
    * Every even number is followed by N / 2
    * Every odd number (except 1) is followed by (3 * N) + 1
    Example: collatz(7) -> [7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8,
                            4, 2, 1].

02. longest_collatz(Lo, Hi) -> {TheLongestStep, ListOfLongestNumber}
    The Collatz sequence eventually converges to 1.
    Find which starting value, in the range Lo to Hi (including both end points)
    takes the longest to converge. If two values take equally long to converge,
    return either value.
    Example: longest_collatz(1, 10000) -> {262,[6171]}.

03. element_reverse(List) -> List
    Reverse the elements but the positions of sub-lists are kept.
    Example: element_reverse([1, 2, [3, 4, [5, 6, 7], 8], 9]) ->
                             [9, 8, [7, 6, [5, 4, 3], 2], 1].

04. remove_duplicate(List) -> List
    Removes duplicate elements of List, the order of elements must be kept.
    Example: remove_duplicate([1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1, 2]) -> [1, 2, 3, 4].

05. skeleton(List) -> List
    Removes all the non-list elements of list List, but retains all the list
    structure (the brackets).
    Example: skeleton([1, [2, [3, 4]], 5, 6, [7], []]) -> [[[]], [], []].

06. eliminate(Value, List) -> List
    Returns the list List with all occurrences of the Value removed, at all
    levels, retaining the list (bracket) structure.
    Example: eliminate(b, [a, b, [b, c, d, [a, [b]]], e]) ->
                      [a, [c, d, [a, []]], e].
             eliminate([b], [a, b, [b, c, d, [a, [b]]], e]) ->
                      [a, b, [b, c, d, [a]], e].
    NOTE: the Value can be anything.

07. quicksort(List) -> List
    Return a quicksorted version of the given list.
    Example: quicksort([5, 3, 7, 8, 4, 1, 6, 2]) -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].

08. sqrt(Integer) -> Float
    Compute the square root of the positive number S, using Newton's method.
    That is, choose some arbitrary number, say 2, as the initial approximation
    R to the square root; then to get the next approximation, compute the
    average of R and N/R. Continue until you have five significant digits to the
    right of the decimal point. Do this by taking an infinite series of
    approximations, and taking approximations until they differ by less than
    0.00001. Xo = 2 and Xn+1 = 1/2 (Xn + S/Xn).
    Example: sqrt(12) -> 3.4641016151377544.

09. sqrt_plus(Integer) -> Float
    Same as above, but perform round estimation to find the initial
    approxamation Xo first.
    Compare the the number of iterations between 2 exercises.
    Example: sqrt(795286) -> 15 times.
             sqrt_plus(795286) -> 6 times.

10. zap_gremlins(Text) -> Text
    Remove from the given text all invalid ASCII characters.
    The Valid characters are decimal 10 (linefeed), 13 (carriage return) and
    32 through 126, inclusive. Remember that Erlang has no "character" type;
    a "string" is just a list of ASCII values.
    Example: zap_gremlins([84,104,105,115,32,235,105,115,3,32,97,12,32,115,116,114,105,110,103,32,105,127,110,32,69,114,108,11,14,97,110,103,33]) -> ?

11. rot_13(Text) -> Text
    Apply the rot-13 transformation to text.
    This is a simple encoding in which each letter is replaced by the letter 13
    further along, end-around. Both uppercase and lowercase letters should be
    rotated; other characters should be unaffected.
    Example: rot_13("This is a string in Erlang!") ->
                    "Guvf vf n fgevat va Reynat!".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PART 2 : ADVANCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
01. Tree contruction
    Given a list (L) of values (V) which can be compared for equality.
    Write a function that traverses the list from Left to Right. The output of
    function is a tree (T) which each node is a 3-tuple {X, V, Y} where V is the
    Value and X, Y are the Left, Right nodes.
    Insertion of elements follow the following rules:
    * Starting at the root node, element greater than the current node element
      go LEFT, element less than or equal to the current node elements go RIGHT.
      Leafs have Left and Right element of 'NULL'.
    Example: tree([2]) -> {'NULL', 2, 'NULL'}
             tree([2, 4, 1]) -> {{'NULL', 4, 'NULL'}, 2, {'NULL', 1, 'NULL'}}
             tree([4, 1, 3, 2, 5]) -> {{'NULL', 5, 'NULL'},
                                       4,
                                       {{'NULL', 3, {'NULL', 2, 'NULL'}},
                                        1,
                                        'NULL'}}

02. Neighboring interval merging
    Give a list L of 2-tuple {V, V} representing intervals.
    Write a function that traverses the list, Left to Right and merges
    overlapping intervals that are neighbors.
    Example: neighbor_merge([{1,5}, {3,7}, {10,14}]) -> [{1,7}, {10, 14}]
             neighbor_merge([{1,5}, {3,7}, {10,14}, {1,9}, {13, 20}]) ->
                            [{1,7}, {10,14}, {1,9}, {13, 20}]
             neighbor_merge([{1, 5}, {3, 7}, {1, 14}]) -> [{1,14}]

03. Calculate percentages
    Give a list of integer.
    Write a function that calculate the percentage (integer) of each value in
    the list. NOTE: make sure that the sum of all percentages = 100%
    Example: percent([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110]) ->
                     [1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PART 3 : PROCESSES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
01. start_ring(N, M) -> ok.
    Write a function which starts N processes in a ring,
    and sends a message M times around all the processes in the ring.
    After the messages have been sent the processes should terminate gracefully.
    Messages sent in a ring of processes.
    Example: start_ring(2, 2).
             -> create process 1: <0.210.0>
             -> create process 2: <0.211.0>
             : process 1 --> send message 3
             : process 2 --> send message 3
             [<0.210.0>,<0.211.0>]
             : process 1 --> send message 2
             : process 2 --> send message 2
             : process 1 --> send message 1
             : process 2 --> send message 1
             * process 1 terminated!
             * process 2 terminated!

02. Write a process that receives strings representing mathematical expressions
    and sends their value back to the sender.
    Now write a process that reads strings from the console, sends it to the
    process and prints the value on the console.
    The strint "-q" shall exit the program.
    Hint: Try to use erl_scan:string, erl_parse:parse_exprs!
    Example: math() ->
             *** start math application ***
             math expression: 1 + 1 - 1
             result: 1
             math expression: 2 + 2 * 2 + 2 / 2
             result: 7.0
             math expression: -q
             result: "server is terminated!"
             *** stop math application ***

03. Using gen_server behavior of erlang for this exercise.
    Create module election_server.erl.
    Write function start(N) that starts n processes in a ring topology and that
    assigns to each process in that ring some random but unique integer ID.
    Implement the following election algorithm:
    * Let each process send its ID "clockwise" around the ring.
    * A process that receives an ID larger than its own ID lost the election and
      just passes received IDs around the ring.
    * The process that receives its own ID wins the election
    Example: election_server:start(5) ->
             ID: [196,31,107,355,382]

             election_server:info() ->
             *** process: 196, next process: election_server_31
             *** process: 31, next process: election_server_107
             *** process: 107, next process: election_server_355
             *** process: 355, next process: election_server_382
             *** process: 382, next process: election_server_196

             election_server:election() ->
             *** process 382: win the election!

             election_server:stop() ->
             *** process election_server_196: terminated!
             *** process election_server_31: terminated!
             *** process election_server_107: terminated!
             *** process election_server_355: terminated!
             *** process election_server_382: terminated!

04. Using gen_statem behavior of erlang for this exercise.
    *** Peterson's Algorithm ***
    Write a function that starts n processes in a ring topology and that assigns
    to each process in that ring some random but unique integer ID.
    Implement the following peterson algorithm:
    * A process is in two states: It is either participating in the election
      (active mode) or forwarding messages (called the relay mode).
      At the beginning, all processes have active mode.
    * Each process send its ID "clockwise" arround the ring.
    * Let say process i has iID, it must receive 2 meesages from i-1 (i-1ID) and
      i-2 (i-2ID) process.
    * If i-1ID is the highest PID, then process i changes its ID to i-1ID and
      send i-1ID to next node.
    * If not, process i switchs to relay mode and only forwarding message.
    * The process that receives its own ID wins the election.
    Example: election_statem:start(5) ->
             ID: [411,430,90,210,358]

             election_statem:info() ->
             *** process id: 411, next node is: election_statem_430
             *** process id: 430, next node is: election_statem_90
             *** process id: 90, next node is: election_statem_210
             *** process id: 210, next node is: election_statem_358
             *** process id: 358, next node is: election_statem_411

             election_statem:election() ->
             *** process 90: update virtual_id: 430
             *** process 210: change to relay mode
             *** process 358: change to relay mode
             *** process 411: change to relay mode
             *** process 430: change to relay mode
             *** processs 90 (430): win the election!

             election_statem:stop() ->
             *** process election_statem_411 terminated!
             *** process election_statem_430 terminated!
             *** process election_statem_90 terminated!
             *** process election_statem_210 terminated!
             *** process election_statem_358 terminated!

Master and Slaves, error handling
This problem illustrates a situation where we have a process (the master) which supervises other processes (the slaves). In a real example the slave could, for example, be controlling different hardware units. The master's job is to ensure that all the slave processes are alive. If a slave crashes (maybe because of a software fault), the master is to recreate the failed slave.
A master supervises other processes
Write a module ms with the following interface:
    - start(N) - Start the master and tell it to start N slave proc- esses. Register the master as the registered process master.
    - to_slave(Message, N) - Send a message to the master and tell it to relay the message to slave N. The slave should exit (and be restarted by the master) if the message is die.
    - The master should detect the fact that a slave processe diea nd restart it and print a message that it has done so.
    -  The slave should print all messages it recieves except the message die
Hints:
The master should trap exit messages and create links to all the slave processes.
The master should keep a list of the process id's (pid's) of the slave processes and their associated numbers.
Example:
    > ms:start(4).
    => true
    > ms:to_slave(hello, 2).
    => {hello,2}
    Slave 2 got message hello
    > ms:to_slave(die, 3).
    => {die,3}
    master restarting dead slave3
Robustness in Erlang, and use of a graphics package
A robust system makes it possible to survive partial failure, i.e if some parts of the system crashes, it should be possible to recover instead of having a total system crash. In this exercise we will build a tree-like hierachy of processes that can recover if any of the tree-branches should
